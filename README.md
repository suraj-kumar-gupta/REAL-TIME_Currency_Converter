# REAL-TIME_Currency_Converter
It is a simple JAVA GUI that deals with conversion of currencies from a list of available currencies. It uses an API (free.currencycoverterapi.com) which returns the real-time converted value in JSON and displays the value in the JAVA GUI.

In this project I have used JFrame of Java GUI that is used to develop the Frontend of the application. The backend part is nothing but a simple HTTP Connection that is made using an API https://free.currencyconverterapi.com. 

There from_currency and to_currency are attached to the URL and the converted value is then mapped with the amount that is provided in the JAVA GUI and the realtive value is calculated.

YOU CAN GET YOUR OWN API at https://free.currencyconverterapi.com and replace it with my API KEY. 

# RUNNING THE PROJECT
Just load up the configurations in NETBEANS IDE and then run the CurrencyConverterPanel.java file in the src folder.
